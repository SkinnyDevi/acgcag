# (ACGCAG) A Certain GUI for a Certain Anime Game

This app aims to make your skin importing experience more smoother inside GI.

Links to the original program, as without this, ACGCAG wouldn't not exist nor work:
- [GIMI](https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer)

## How to install
**Pre-requisites: Have installed in your computer a unpacking program, most commonly: WinRAR or 7zip.**
WinRAR has been tested to work with the app.

1. Go to the `Releases` section of this page and download the latest version of `ACGCAG-Launcher.zip`
2. Once downloaded, extract the zip file anywhere you plan on using this app.
3. Make sure you read the documents inside the zip file (especially the `INSTALL_GUIDE.txt`).
4. Open the app.
5. Run throught the setup.
6. Have fun!

## How to launch GIMI
Press the play button in the left-bottom hand side of the app.

Wait for GIMI's command window to close (this happens soon after launching the game)
and then you may continue using the app.

## How to import skins from GameBanana
1. Press the Banana Button (lower left of the app) or head over to [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/games/8552) and find a skin you like.
2. Copy the website URL of the skin; it should be something like this: https://gamebanana.com/mods/467184
3. Paste the website URL inside the Import Mods section in the app.
- (Consecutive) Downloads sometimes may take a while, please be patient and don't change tabs in the app. 
4. Run through the download process and done!

**NOTE:** shader fixes **do not** auto install. Shader fixes must be installed manually.
You can find the GIMI folder under `ACGCAG/3dmigoto`

## How to enable/disable or delete mods
1. Find your desired skin inside the Downloaded Mods tab.
2. Press the 'Manage' button.
3. Click install/uninstall to enable/disable the skin.
4. Click delete if you wish to remove that skin from your system.
